# Draw-Guess-Socket
drawing & guessing game for your phone. 🖌️
Do your best to draw the word you are given while players try to guess it!

## About the project
The project was written in two days and included a variety of technologies -
The files were compiled using gulp file and webpack.
For the streaming and passing the data and the board as a game I used 'Websocket'.

### Technologys:
#### front:
- React
- HTML
- CSS
The client side was very comfortable to build with React because of
the States changes and controling the data.
#### back:
- Node.JS
- Websocket
- Express
- PostgreSQL
I used Websocket for streaming the game beatween 2 players, it was
intresting to build and control the browser state by other browser.
